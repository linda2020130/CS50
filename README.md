<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

CS50 teaches students how to **think algorithmically** and **solve problems efficiently**. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students‚Äô choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); or Lua (for game development). Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. <br>

<h2 id="week1">Week 1 C</h2>

[üê≥](/Week%201%20C)
1. [Using the Linux command line](/Week%201%20C/CommandLine.md): Common Linux CLI commands including `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv` and how to compile the C languages source code into machine code.
2. **Problem Set 1**: 
    * [Hello](/Week%201%20C/hello.c): 
      * **Output**: Return `hello, XXX` after user inputs the name.
    * [Mario](/Week%201%20C/mario.c): 
      * **Output**: Return the **pyramids** using hashes (`#`) for bricks after user inputs how tall the pyramids should be. 
      * <details><summary>Constraints:</summary>
         <p>If the user doesn‚Äôt input a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate.</p>
         </details>
      * **Illustration**:<br>![mario](/Pictures/mario.PNG)
    * [Cash](/Week%201%20C/cash.c):
      * **Output**: Return the **minimum number of coins** that the user's input (how much change he/she owned) can be made.
      * <details><summary>Constraints:</summary>
   
        1. The only coins available are quarters (25¬¢), dimes (10¬¢), nickels (5¬¢), and pennies (1¬¢).
        2. Only allow user to input float number(use `get_float`). The program should re-prompt the users until they cooperate.
        3. Round your cents to the nearest penny, as with round, which is declared in `math.h`.
        4. Beware the inherent imprecision of floating-point values. Convert the user‚Äôs inputted dollars to cents (i.e., from a `float` to an `int`) to avoid tiny errors that might otherwise add up!

      * **Illustration**:<br>![cash](/Pictures/cash.PNG)
    * [Credit](/Week%201%20C/credit.c):
      * **Output**: Return `VISA`, `AMEX`, `MASTERCARD`, or `INVALID` after user inputs a credit card number.
      * <details><summary>Constraints:</summary>
   
        1. The program should re-prompt the users until they input entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card). 
        2. According to *Luhn‚Äôs algorithm*, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid.
        3. All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other potential starting numbers which we won‚Äôt concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4.

<h2 id="week2">Week 2 Arrays</h2>

[üê≥](/Week%202%20Arrays)
1. [Arrays](/Week%202%20Arrays/Arrays.md): Important features of arrays and the way to declare an array in C. *Call by value vs. call by reference* are also covered.
2. [Variable Scope](/Week%202%20Arrays/VariableScope.md): Definitions and examples of *local variables* and *global variables*.
3. **Problem Set 2**:
   * [Readability](/Week%202%20Arrays/readability.c):
      * **Output**: Return the approximate grade level after user input some text.
      * <details><summary>Constraints:</summary>
   
        1. Use the *Coleman-Liau index* (`index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8`) to compute the grade reading level. Here, L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
        2. Prompt the user for a `string` of text using `get_string`.
        3. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from a to z or any uppercase character from A to Z, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
        4. If the resulting index number is 16 or higher, your program should output `Grade 16+`. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output `Before Grade 1`.

   * [Caesar](/Week%202%20Arrays/caesar.c):
      * **Output**: Return encrypted messages using *Caesar's cipher*.
      * <details><summary>Constraints:</summary>
   
        1. Caesar‚Äôs algorithm (i.e., cipher) encrypts messages by ‚Äúrotating‚Äù each letter by k positions. 
        2. Accept a single command-line argument, a non-negative integer k. Return `Usage: ./caesar key` if not receive exactly one command-line argument from user.
        3. Work for all non-negative integral values of k less than 2^31 - 26.
        4. Output `plaintext:` and then prompt the user for a string of plaintext (using `get_string`).
        5. Output `ciphertext:` followed by the plaintext‚Äôs corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext ‚Äúrotated‚Äù by k positions.
        6. Non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged and case must be preserved.

      * <details><summary>Illustration:</summary>
   
         ```
         $ ./caesar 1
         plaintext:  HELLO
         ciphertext: IFMMP
         $ ./caesar HELLO
         Usage: ./caesar key
         ```
         </details>
   * [Substitution](/Week%202%20Arrays/substitution.c): Return a substitution cipher.
      <details><summary>Constraints:</summary>
   
        1. Encrypt a message by replacing every letter with another letter using a 26-character mapping key.
        2. Accept a single command-line argument, a 26-character mapping key. Return `Usage: ./substitution key` if not receive exactly one command-line argument from user. Return `Key must contain 26 characters.` if not receive exactly 26 characters.
        3. Output `plaintext:` and then prompt the user for a string of plaintext (using `get_string`).
        4. Output `ciphertext:` followed by the plaintext‚Äôs corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext substituted for the corresponding character in the ciphertext.
        5. Non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged and case must be preserved.
