[üê≥](/Week%201%20C)
1. [Using the Linux command line](/Week%201%20C/CommandLine.md): Common Linux CLI commands including `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv` and how to compile the C languages source code into machine code.
2. **Problem Set 1**: 
    * [Hello](/Week%201%20C/hello.c): Return `hello, XXX` after user inputs the name.
    * [Mario](/Week%201%20C/mario.c): Return the **pyramids** using hashes (`#`) for bricks after user inputs how tall the pyramids should be. 
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
      <p>If the user doesn‚Äôt input a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate.</p>
      </details>
      <details><summary>Illustration:</summary>
      
      ```
      $ ./mario

      </details>
    * [Cash](/Week%201%20C/cash.c): Return the **minimum number of coins** that the user's input (how much change he/she owned) can be made.
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
   
      1. The only coins available are quarters (25¬¢), dimes (10¬¢), nickels (5¬¢), and pennies (1¬¢).
      2. Only allow user to input float number(use `get_float`). The program should re-prompt the users until they cooperate.
      3. Round your cents to the nearest penny, as with round, which is declared in `math.h`.
      4. Beware the inherent imprecision of floating-point values. Convert the user‚Äôs inputted dollars to cents (i.e., from a `float` to an `int`) to avoid tiny errors that might otherwise add up!
      </details>
      <details><summary>Illustration:</summary>
      
      ```
      $ ./cash
      Change owed: -0.41
      Change owed: foo
      Change owed: 0.41
      4
      ```
      </details>
    * [Credit](/Week%201%20C/credit.c): Return `VISA`, `AMEX`, `MASTERCARD`, or `INVALID` after user inputs a credit card number.
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
   
      1. The program should re-prompt the users until they input entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card). 
      2. According to *Luhn‚Äôs algorithm*, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid.
      3. All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other potential starting numbers which we won‚Äôt concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4.

<h2 id="week2">Week 2 Arrays</h2>

[üê≥](/Week%202%20Arrays)
1. [Arrays](/Week%202%20Arrays/Arrays.md): Important features of arrays and the way to declare an array in C. *Call by value vs. call by reference* are also covered.
2. [Variable Scope](/Week%202%20Arrays/VariableScope.md): Definitions and examples of *local variables* and *global variables*.
3. **Problem Set 2**:
   * [Readability](/Week%202%20Arrays/readability.c): Return the approximate grade level after user input some text.
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
   
      1. Use the *Coleman-Liau index* (`index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8`) to compute the grade reading level. Here, L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
      2. Prompt the user for a `string` of text using `get_string`.
      3. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from a to z or any uppercase character from A to Z, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
      4. If the resulting index number is 16 or higher, your program should output `Grade 16+`. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output `Before Grade 1`.

      $ ./readability
      Text: Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework, but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard.
      Grade 5
      $ ./readability
      Text: A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains.

      </details>
   * [Caesar](/Week%202%20Arrays/caesar.c): Return encrypted messages using *Caesar's cipher*.
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
   
      1. Caesar‚Äôs algorithm (i.e., cipher) encrypts messages by ‚Äúrotating‚Äù each letter by k positions. 
      2. Accept a single command-line argument, a non-negative integer k. Return `Usage: ./caesar key` if not receive exactly one command-line argument from user.
      3. Work for all non-negative integral values of k less than 2^31 - 26.
      4. Output `plaintext:` and then prompt the user for a string of plaintext (using `get_string`).
      5. Output `ciphertext:` followed by the plaintext‚Äôs corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext ‚Äúrotated‚Äù by k positions.
      6. Non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged and case must be preserved.

      1. Encrypt a message by replacing every letter with another letter using a 26-character mapping key.
      2. Accept a single command-line argument, a 26-character mapping key. Return `Usage: ./substitution key` if not receive exactly one command-line argument from user. Return `Key must contain 26 characters.` if not receive exactly 26 characters.
      3. Output `plaintext:` and then prompt the user for a string of plaintext (using `get_string`).
      4. Output `ciphertext:` followed by the plaintext‚Äôs corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext substituted for the corresponding character in the ciphertext.
      5. Non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged and case must be preserved.

      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
      
      1. The maximum number of candidates an election can have is 9.
      2. Sets a global variable `candidate_count` representing the number of candidates in the election, copies command-line arguments into the array `candidates`, and asks the user to type in the number of voters.
      3. Every voter type in a vote, calling the `vote` function on each candidate voted for.
      4. `main` makes a call to the `print_winner` function to print out the winner (or winners) of the election.
      5. `vote` takes a single argument, a `string` called `name`, representing the name of the candidate who was voted for. Indicate an invalid ballot if not match any name.
      6. May assume that no two candidates will have the same name.

      ```
      </details>
    * [Runoff](/Week%203%20Algorithms/runoff.c): Run a runoff election, a ranked-choice voting system. Voters can rank the candidates in order of preference. 
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
   
      1. If no candidate has a majority of the votes, the last place candidate is eliminated, and anyone who voted for them will instead vote for their next preference. Once a candidate has a majority, that candidate is declared the winner.
      2. All candidates who are tied for last place will be eliminated. Declare the election a tie if every remaining candidate has the exact same number of votes.
      3. Assume that all voters will rank all of the candidates in their preferred order.
      4. An election with any number of candidate (up to the MAX of 9).
      5. Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot.
      6. Voting for a candidate by name and may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.
      </details>

      Alice
      ```
      </details>
    * [Tideman](/Week%203%20Algorithms/tideman.c): Run a Tideman election, a ranked-choice voting system. Voters can rank the candidates in order of preference.
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
      
      1. The Tideman method works by constructing a ‚Äúgraph‚Äù of candidates, where an arrow (i.e. edge) from candidate A to candidate B indicates that candidate A wins against candidate B in a head-to-head matchup. The winner of the election should be the ‚Äúsource‚Äù of the graph
      2. The Tideman algorithm specifies that matchup edges should be ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù to the graph one at a time, based on the ‚Äústrength‚Äù of the victory (the more people who prefer a candidate over their opponent, the stronger the victory). So long as the edge can be locked into the graph without creating a cycle, the edge is added; otherwise, the edge is ignored.
      3. An election with any number of candidate (up to the MAX of 9)
      4. Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot.
      5. Voting for a candidate by name and may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.
