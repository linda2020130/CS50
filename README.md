CS50 teaches students how to **think algorithmically** and **solve problems efficiently**. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students‚Äô choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); or Lua (for game development). Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences.

1. [Using the Linux command line](/Week%201%20C/CommandLine.md): Common Linux CLI commands including `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv` and how to compile the C languages source code into machine code.
2. **Problem Set 1**:
   * [Hello](/Week%201%20C/hello.c): Return `hello, XXX` after user inputs the name.
   * [Mario](/Week%201%20C/mario.c): Return the **pyramids** using hashes (`#`) for bricks after user inputs how tall the pyramids should be.\

   * [Cash](/Week%201%20C/cash.c): Return the **minimum number of coins** that the user's input (how much change he/she owned) can be made.
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
   
      1. The only coins available are quarters (25¬¢), dimes (10¬¢), nickels (5¬¢), and pennies (1¬¢).
      2. Only allow user to input float number(use `get_float`). The program should re-prompt the users until they cooperate.
      3. Round your cents to the nearest penny, as with round, which is declared in `math.h`.
      4. Beware the inherent imprecision of floating-point values. Convert the user‚Äôs inputted dollars to cents (i.e., from a `float` to an `int`) to avoid tiny errors that might otherwise add up!
      </details>

      4
      ```
      </details>
   * [Credit](/Week%201%20C/credit.c): Return `VISA`, `AMEX`, `MASTERCARD`, or `INVALID` after user inputs a credit card number.
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
   
      1. The program should re-prompt the users until they input entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card). 
      2. According to *Luhn‚Äôs algorithm*, you can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid.
      3. All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37; most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 (they also have some other potential starting numbers which we won‚Äôt concern ourselves with for this problem); and all Visa numbers start with 4.

      1. Use the *Coleman-Liau index* (`index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8`) to compute the grade reading level. Here, L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
      2. Prompt the user for a `string` of text using `get_string`.
      3. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from a to z or any uppercase character from A to Z, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
      4. If the resulting index number is 16 or higher, your program should output `Grade 16+`. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output `Before Grade 1`.

      3. Every voter type in a vote, calling the `vote` function on each candidate voted for.
      4. `main` makes a call to the `print_winner` function to print out the winner (or winners) of the election.
      5. `vote` takes a single argument, a `string` called `name`, representing the name of the candidate who was voted for. Indicate an invalid ballot if not match any name.
      6. May assume that no two candidates will have the same name.

      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
   
      1. If no candidate has a majority of the votes, the last place candidate is eliminated, and anyone who voted for them will instead vote for their next preference. Once a candidate has a majority, that candidate is declared the winner.
      2. All candidates who are tied for last place will be eliminated. Declare the election a tie if every remaining candidate has the exact same number of votes.
      3. Assume that all voters will rank all of the candidates in their preferred order.
      4. An election with any number of candidate (up to the MAX of 9).
      5. Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot.

   * [Tideman](/Week%203%20Algorithms/tideman.c): Run a Tideman election, a ranked-choice voting system. Voters can rank the candidates in order of preference.
      <details><summary>Details:</summary>
      
      1. The Tideman method works by constructing a ‚Äúgraph‚Äù of candidates, where an arrow (i.e. edge) from candidate A to candidate B indicates that candidate A wins against candidate B in a head-to-head matchup. The winner of the election should be the ‚Äúsource‚Äù of the graph
      2. The Tideman algorithm specifies that matchup edges should be ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù to the graph one at a time, based on the ‚Äústrength‚Äù of the victory (the more people who prefer a candidate over their opponent, the stronger the victory). So long as the edge can be locked into the graph without creating a cycle, the edge is added; otherwise, the edge is ignored.
      3. An election with any number of candidate (up to the MAX of 9)
      4. Invalid votes for candidates who are not on the ballot.
      5. Voting for a candidate by name and may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.

      * `import.py`:
         1. Should accept the name of a CSV file as a command-line argument. Return an error until the users cooperate.
         2. May assume that the CSV file will exist, and will have columns `name`, `house`, and `birth`.
         3. For each student in the CSV file, insert the student into the `students` table in the `students.db` database.
         4. May assume that each person‚Äôs name field will contain either two space-separated names (a first and last name) or three space-separated names (a first, middle, and last name). Leave their middle name field as NULL in the table if no middle name.
      * `roster.py`:
         1. Should accept the name of a house as a command-line argument. Return an error until the users cooperate.
         2. Should query the `students` table in the `students.db` database for all of the students in the specified house.
         3. Each student should be printed on their own line.
         4. Students should be ordered by last name. For students with the same last name, they should be ordered by first name.
