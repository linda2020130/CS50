            <h2>1. Determined</h2>
            <p class="style_text indent_text">The ability to control and motivate myself to stick to my schedule helps me lose 15 lbs,
            learn new things such as Python, and develop good habits such as reading. I like to set up several goals for myself and then achieve them step by step as scheduled.
            A goal is like a destination to me. Once the destination is known, I will plan on how to get there, estimate how long it will take, and execute my plan.</p>
            <p class="style_text indent_text">One of my goals in 2020 was to learn about fundamental knowledge in computer science, so I decided to take the online course CS50.
            However, as a full-time staff, I spent about 12 hours on work including commuting time on weekdays.
            Therefore, I divided the course lectures into smaller sections and took at least one section on weekdays and more on weekends.
            Finally, with my persistence of almost half-year long, I not only finished all the lectures and homework but also identified a new career potential.</p><br>
            <h2>2. Observant</h2>
            <p class="style_text indent_text">I always pay attention to details and think one step further for people.
            I am a sensitive person, so it is natural for me to care about people's feelings and put myself in their shoes.</p>
            <p class="style_text indent_text">Few years ago, when I was a buyer, my supervisor asked me to combine the customer's future demand in the excel file for her.
            Basically, what she needed was the demand quantities for each future month. I assumed that she was trying to come up a purchasing schedule.
            So, I not only gave her the demand quantities but also provided her the current inventory information and highlighted the month we should place another order based on vendors' lead time.
            It turned out my guess was right and what I did was actually helping our team to improve our processing efficiency.</p><br>
            <h2>3. Dependable</h2>
            <p class="style_text indent_text">I am highly concerned about my reputation. Dependable is the word I hope people to describe me, so I always keep my promise.
            I do a lot of small things to make myself a reliable person. For example, I get ready earlier so that I don't be late or even skip my appointment or meeting.
            I finish my work as soon as possible without any noticeable mistakes so that I can make the project go well.
            Overall, I don't make any promises for things that I don't think I can do, but I will keep their request in mind and try my best to make it happen.</p><br>
